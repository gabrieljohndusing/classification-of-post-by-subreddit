# WHAT DO I WIN?

Not a damn thing. Nothing. Zero, zilch, nada.

I'm kidding, of course. Here's what you'll win:

1st place will receive a one-way ticket to Mars after Elon Musk finishes building his colony there. Also, you will win something special from me. What will it be? Probably nothing very important or even slightly special. Seriously, here's the prizes:

* **1ST PLACE:** A special prize from the mod team, to be announced later. And, a custom personal flair, and your story will receive a fancy flair as well! Also, a link to your story will appear on November's announcement page.
* **2ND &amp; 3RD PLACE:** A custom personal flair, and your post will receive a special flair as well.

Now, because it's no secret that some of you have a slightly difficult time understanding basic instructions unless a picture is provided, I'm going to show you how your post should look:

&amp;#x200B;

In the title box, you would enter the first sentence like normal, and it should look like this:

    [OCT2020] Funerals are great because (and then add your own words here)

And then in the text box just add your second sentence.

**IMPROPERLY FORMATTED ENTRIES WILL BE DISQUALIFIED!**

Good luck, and if you have any questions, post them in the comments below."
