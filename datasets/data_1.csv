I've made some cosmetic changes; new banner, new icon, scratch-n-sniff sticker flairs, and a few other things. I'd appreciate it if you let me know if the formatting doesn't look correct on your device. (New Reddit can be a little quirky, so it may take a few attempts to work out the bugs.

We've got a Discord server now! Here's a link if you'd like to join: [Touch me!](https://discord.gg/dg8Kcsc) This will be a good place to meet up with others, including mods, and will replace Reddit's integrated chat, which has more bugs than a hotel mattress.

Additionally, I'll be trying to help streamline the rules/reporting system a bit. Any suggestions are welcome!

Hope you enjoy the changes!"
